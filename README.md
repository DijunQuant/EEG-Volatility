# EEG-Volatility
The project provides scripts for analyzing EEG spectral volatility

1. Raw EEG files were first processed in Matlab to compute spectral powers using wavelet transformation. Outputs are available on OSF (under exports): https://osf.io/5tsh6/
2. Python code in the current repository is used to compute volatilities and generate intermediate files for further analyses. Data is available on OSF (under processed): https://osf.io/5tsh6/
3. Final results and plots are produced by the iPython notebook using intermediate files. Due to the size limit, the notebook is available on OSF https://osf.io/tqcde.
