# EEG-Volatility
code for analyzing EEG spectral volatility

Raw EEG files were first processed in Matlab to compute spectral powers using wavelet transformation
Outputs are available on OSF: https://osf.io/5tsh6/
Python code in the current repository is used to compute volatilities for further analysis. 
Final results and plots are produced by iPython notebook. Due to the size limit, the notebook is available on OSF https://osf.io/tqcde.
